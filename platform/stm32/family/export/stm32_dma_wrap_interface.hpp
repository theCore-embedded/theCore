//! Generic interface of the DMA on STM32 platforms.
//! \details The STM32 MCU family module must implement each method in its own
//! headers. Depends on the family the entity behind the class may differ.
//! E.g. in STM32F4 each DMA instance is unambiguously described by the pair of
//! "stream" and "channel" in contrast to just "channel" in STM32L1.
//! Template parameter allows to incapsulate additional methods into
//! separate class required by the MCU family while keeping in it the scope
//! of a base class and not exposing it in its body.
//! \tparam Impl Desired additional implementation, defined by the platform.
