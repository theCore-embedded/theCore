//! Generic bus interface.
//! \details The generic bus is useful adapter, that allows to:
//! - Encapsulate locking policy when multithreded environment is used.
//! - Hide differences between full-duplex and half-duplex busses.
//! - Define and simplify platform-level bus interface
//! \tparam PBus Platform-level bus driver (I2C, SPI, etc.)
//!
//! This class uses one of methods to prevent “static initialization order
//! fiasco” to handle initialization of the static members.
//! See https://isocpp.org/wiki/faq/ctors

    //! Locks a bus.
    //! \details Any further operations can be executed after call to this function.
    //! If previous async xfer is in progress then current thread will be blocked
    //! until its finish.

    static void lock();

    //! Unlocks a bus.
    //! \details Any operations beside lock() is not permitted after this method finishes.
    //! \par Side effects:
    //! \li In block mode all buffers provided with set_buffers() will be discarded
    //! \li In async mode if operation still ongoing, buffers will be discarded
    //!     after operation will finish.
    //!
    //! \pre    Bus is locked.
    //! \post   Bus is unlocked.
    //! \sa     set_buffers()
    //!
    static void unlock();

    //! Sets RX and TX buffers and their sizes.
    //! \details If only TX or RX transaction required, then only one buffer must
    //! be passed. All effects from calls to set_buffers() will be discarded.
    //! \par Side effects:
    //! \li Bus will remember all buffers, until unlock() or set_buffers()
    //!     will be called.
    //! \pre       Bus is locked.
    //! \post      Bus is ready to execute xfer.
    //! \param[in] tx   Data to transmit.
    //!                 If this param is null, then rx must be set.
    //! \param[in] rx   Buffer to receive a data. Optional.
    //!                 If this param is null, then tx must be set.
    //! \param[in] size Size of buffers. Zero is valid size.
    //! \retval    err::ok      Buffers successfully set.
    //! \retval    err::inval   Both buffers are null.
    //! \retval    err::busy    Device is still executing async xfer.
    //!
    static err set_buffers(const uint8_t *tx, uint8_t *rx, size_t size);

    //! Sets TX buffer size and fills it with given byte.
    //! \details This will instruct a platform bus to send a byte given number
    //! of times. It is implementation defined how platform-level bus handles
    //! incoming data, e.g. it can be splitted into chunks when sending to
    //! the destination, if platform bus protocol allows such thing.
    //! \details In half-duplex case RX will not be performed. If platform bus
    //! is in full duplex mode then RX will be executed but RX data will be
    //! ignored.
    //! \par Side effects
    //! - Bus will remember a buffer, until unlock() or set_buffers() will
    //!   be called.
    //! \pre       Bus is locked.
    //! \post      Bus is ready to execute xfer.
    //! \param[in] size         Size of filled buffer.
    //! \param[in] fill_byte    Byte which will be sent in TX stream.
    //! \retval    err::ok      Buffer successfully set and filled.
    //! \retval    err::busy    Device is still executing async xfer.
    //!
    static err set_buffers(size_t size, uint8_t fill_byte = 0xff);

    //! Performs xfer in blocking mode using buffers set previously.
    //! \details If underlying bus works in half-duplex mode then first
    //! tx transaction will occur and then rx. Any deffered xfer will be
    //! canceled in result of this call and simple, blocking xfer will proceed.
    //! \warning Method uses a semaphore to wait for a bus event (most likely
    //! an IRQ event). It means that in bare-metal environment,
    //! without RTOS it is implemented as simple spin-lock. Likely that
    //! such behavior is unwanted. In order to control event handling,
    //! consider using xfer(const handler_fn &handler) overload.
    //! \pre        Bus is locked and buffers are set.
    //! \post       Bus remains in the same state.
    //! \param[out] sent        Optional. Bytes sent during this xfer.
    //! \param[out] received    Optional. Bytes received during this xfer.
    //! \retval     err::ok     Data is sent successfully.
    //! \retval     err::busy   Device is still executing async xfer.
    //! \retval     err::io     Transaction started but failed.
    //! \retval     err         Any other error that can occur in platform bus
    //!
    static err xfer(size_t *sent = nullptr, size_t *received = nullptr);

    //! Performs xfer in async mode using buffers set previously.
    //! \details If underlying bus works in half-duplex mode then first
    //! tx transaction will occur and then rx. When xfer will be done, given
    //! handler will be invoked with a type of an event.
    //! \details It is also possible to postpone xfer, i.e. "defer" it
    //! and then trigger at will using xfer_trigger() method. See xfer_trigger()
    //! for more defails. Any previous defered xfer will be canceled in result
    //! of this call.
    //! \warning Event handler most likely will be executed in ISR context.
    //! Pay attention to it. Do not block inside of it or do anything else that
    //! can break ISR or impose high interrupt latency.
    //! \note Bytes transferred are reported via user-supplied handler
    //! per each channel (tx, rx) separately.
    //! \note Errors that occur after transaction has started are reported via
    //! user-supplied handler.
    //! \sa PBus::event
    //! \pre       Bus is locked and buffers are set.
    //! \post      Bus remains in the same state.

    //! \param[in] type      Type of xfer. Possible values are:
    //!                      - async_type::immediate:
    //!                      xfer will be started as soon as possible.
    //!                      - async_type::deferred:
    //!                      xfer will be postponed until xfer_trigger() call
    //! \retval    err::ok   Data is sent successfully.
    //! \retval    err::busy Device is still executing async xfer.
    //! \retval    err       Any other error that can occur in platform bus.
    //!
    static err xfer(const bus_handler &handler, async_type type = async_type::immediate);

    //! Triggers continued or deffered xfer in async mode.
    //! \details Method is capable of triggering two types of xfers:
    //!  - Continuated:
    //!    triggers a new xfer with the same buffers and handlers that were used
    //!    during last xfer.
    //!  - Deffered:
    //!    triggers the scheduled xfer, such that was defer using xfer() call.
    //! \details This method is a kind of a important optimization trick. It is
    //! possible to call it from IRQ context. It uses buffers and handlers
    //! from previous xfers, so there is no overhead for unneeded assignments.
    //! \pre       Bus is locked, buffers are set and async xfer is either
    //!            defered or executed.
    //! \post      Xfer is ongoing.
